# OOPS.js (For Node.js)#

----------

(For the original library and **complete usage instructions**, please see: [https://github.com/Cleod9/oopsjs](https://github.com/Cleod9/oopsjs))

This library is a Node.js port of [OOPS.js](https://github.com/Cleod9/oopsjs).

## Installation ##

```
npm install oopsjs
```

And that's it! You can then start using it by simply requiring the oopsjs package:

```javascript
var OOPS = require('oopsjs');
```

You will then have access to the library through the variable `OOPS`.  And as with most Node.js modules, the reference you pull by requiring the module will be shared across all of your files that do `require('oopsjs')`.

See below for a quick example:

```
//Define a class
var AwesomeClass = OOPS.extend({
	_constructor_: function() {
		console.log('An awesome class has been created!');
	}
});

//Create an instance of your class
var myAwesomeClass = new AwesomeClass();
```

For **full instructions**, see the original [OOPS.js](https://github.com/Cleod9/oopsjs).

This library also works great with [ImportJS for Node](https://github.com/Cleod9/node-importjs)!
